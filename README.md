# Travelling-Salesperson-Problem
ALGORITHM REFERENCE:
 * 	NEAREST NEIGHBOR: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nearest_neighbour_algorithm
 * 	TWO OPT: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2-opt
 * 	DYNAMIC PROGRAMMING: https://github.com/williamfiset/Algorithms/blob/master/com/williamfiset/algorithms/graphtheory/TspDynamicProgrammingIterative.java
 *
 * RUNNING INSTRUCTIONS:
 * 
 * 	To run a certain txt file rename the "FILE_NAME" with appropreate filename and location
 * 	
 * 	Run the desiered algorithm from the init() function and comment out the other two for better performance
 * 	Do not run nearestNeighbor() and twoOptOptimizer() at the same time from init() as nearestNeighbor() runs within twoOptOptimizer()
 *
